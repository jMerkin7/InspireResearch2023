A compilation of Mineflayer programs in Python, personal server setup, and possibly more.
All resources are open-source. I intend to properly fork from mineflayer and respective plugins.

These programs are written mostly in Python. The javascript (JSPyBridge) package is neccessary for mineflayer to work with Python
script. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher and Node.js installed. Since Mineflayer is designed for javascript, JSPyBridge will
generate a Node_Modules folder in your python directory; this is where your javascript libraries will be insalled using npm. 
Python libraries can be installed using pip or pip3 as expected. Scripts were designed on the Windows 11 OS, so certain
packages/libraries may not be available to you if you use a different OS. For example, the python package 'pygetwindow' is currently
only configured for Windows devices and VMs running Windows. 

I'm fairly new to python and Github, so I may not do things in the most effective way. Criticism and advice are appreciated

***Im currently trying to fugure out how to uplaod my server files directly to this repository; the files are quite large***
